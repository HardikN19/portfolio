        <p>Hello everyone in this article I will be talking about CSS basics which is one of the three main elements of web technology which most beginners are not aware of, let me clarify before starting that I am not going to cover syntax of CSS.</p>

        <p>Even if you are not a designer, you have probably heard of HTML. Language is the most important language and has been around since the nineties. What you may not be familiar with is CSS. 
            It is an equally important part of the program, and along with HTML and JavaScript, 
            CSS is one of the three main elements of web technology. But what is CSS, how does it work, and why is it so important? Keep reading and reading.</p>

        <h2>So, What exactly CSS is?</h2>
        <p>CSS represents cascade style sheets. In short, CSS is a design language that makes a website look more attractive than simple or uninteresting pieces of text. While HTML determines the content of text, CSS determines visual structure, layout, and beauty. HTML is a tag language, and CSS is a style sheet language..</p>

        <h4>Imagine</h4>
        <p>If HTML is a car, CSS would be the body style and function of painting. 
            A website can work without CSS, but it is not good at all. CSS makes the end of a website shine and creates a good user experience. 
            Without CSS, websites will be less attractive and may be more difficult to navigate. 
            In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and more.</p>

            <h4>Not only that... But also helps to</h4>
            <p>
                <br><span>1. Improve User Experience: </span> <br>
                CSS not only makes web pages easier for the eyes, but also allows for easy-to-use formats. 
                When the buttons and text are in a logical and well-organized position, 
                user experience improves.

                <br><br><span>2.Easily formatting: </span> <br>
                If you need to change the format of a particular set of pages, it is easy to do so with CSS. 
                There is no need to edit each page. Just edit the corresponding CSS style sheet 
                and you will see the changes applied to all pages using that style sheet.

                <br><br><span>3.Fast speed: </span> <br>
                Additional code means slow page speed. And CSS lets you use small code. 
                CSS allows you to apply one CSS rule and apply it to every particular tag 
                in the HTML document.

        <h2>Wanna try?</h2>
        <p>As you can see, CSS is important when it comes to the complete presentation of a web page. And not only that, it makes the life of an engineer much easier when it comes to formatting. Mastering CSS is an important part of being an important asset and a solid designer.<br><br>
