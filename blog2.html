        <p><p>Getting confuse whether to opt computer science or not? Hello, everyone in this blog I will be talking about how to remove your confusions about Computer Science.</p></p>
        <h3>How you see yourself?</h3>
        <p>The first question is how you see yourself? If you see yourself as innovative, designing solving real world problems using technology and creating software programs, 
            then computer science may be the right course for you to learn. 
            Whether you are thinking of becoming a manager or administrator in a technology business or if you are thinking about becoming a 
            researcher in the field of technology, a computer science degree and knowledge can give you the background you need to achieve your goals. 
            computer science can give you the skills and knowledge you need to succeed..</p>

        <h3>What Computer Science is..</h3>
        <p>Computer science is a dynamic and rapidly evolving field. Nowadays it becomes an integral part of the world. Having knowledge of this field will give you a deeper understanding of emerging theory and technology. 
            This knowledge and experience will allow you to develop state of the art solutions to today's challenges. 
            When used in a multidisciplinary approach, students can also use other areas of interest such as business, economics, biology, other engineering background, information security and cyber security, languages ​​and languages, 
            mathematics, physics,etc to discuss a wide range of complex issues.
        </p>

        <h3>Fields in computer Science</h3>
        <p>Before deciding which computer science field program you will enter, 
            you will first need to decide where you see yourself working and what you see yourself doing. 
            Do you prefer to work alone or working in a team? Do you want to build applications or websites? Do you want to analyze the data or protect it? 
            As you can see, you have a lot of options so the best way to answer this question is to look at popular programs and where they can lead. By doing so, 
            you will also learn how to study computer science intentionally based on your career goals.</p>
